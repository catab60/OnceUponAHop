**Once Upon a Hop** is a fun 3D platformer project made by a group of enthusiastic students for the ITEC 2025 competition. In our game, you control a 2D bunny trying to escape from an evil zoo so he can reunite with his wife. We built the game and our custom 3D engine from scratch using Python, Pygame, and OpenGL all while learning a ton along the way.

## What’s It About?

After a peaceful life, our bunny gets trapped in a not-so-friendly zoo. With courage (and some clever hopping), he escapes and embarks on an emotional journey through various environments. You’ll meet other animals and team up with them, all while exploring a mix of classic side-scrolling action and dynamic 3D worlds. The project explores themes of freedom, nature, and the power of reconnecting with the outdoors to boost mental well-being.

## Features

- **Unique Blend of 2D & 3D:** Play as a 2D bunny in a fully realized 3D world.
- **Custom Engine:** Our in-house built 3D engine in Python powers the game.
- **Emotional Story:** Experience a heartfelt adventure of escape, teamwork, and the pursuit of freedom.
- **Creative Environments:** Explore diverse zoo settings and natural landscapes.
- **Challenging Development:** Took us 3 sleepless days to overcome the biggest challenge... building the engine. Implementing 3D graphics alongside 2D, along with gravity, collision detection, and other essential game engine mechanics, pushed our skills to the limit.
- **Student-Made:** Built entirely by a team of passionate students during our ITEC 2025 project.

## Gameplay & Controls

**Objective:**  
Help the bunny escape the zoo and reunite with his wife while overcoming obstacles and puzzles, and teaming up with other animal friends along the way.

**Controls:**  
- **Movement:** `W`, `A`, `D`  
- **Interact:** `E`  
- **Animal Action:** `F`  
- **Select Animal:** `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`  

*Fun Fact:* The game also aims to teach players about nature’s positive impact on mental health and guides you through five unique paths to deepen your connection with the natural world.

## How to Run It

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x:** Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
- **Libraries:** You'll need Pygame and OpenGL. Install them with:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame PyOpenGL
  ```

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/catab60/OnceUponAHop.git
   cd OnceUponAHop
   ```
2. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python main.exe
   ```
   *(If you’re on a system that supports running executables directly, just run `main.exe`.)*

## About the Project

This project was a massive learning experience for us. We built everything from scratch from our custom 3D engine to the final game. One of the biggest challenges was developing the engine itself, which required integrating 3D graphics with classic 2D gameplay. Adding critical game engine foundations like gravity, collision detection, and physics, all in just 3 sleepless days, really pushed our boundaries as developers.
